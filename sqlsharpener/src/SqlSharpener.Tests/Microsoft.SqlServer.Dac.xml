            <remarks>
            Only defined where default values differ from the core defaults.
            When new options are added to SqlDeploymentOptions or a default value changed,
            all clients must determine if they must override the default.
            Redundantly specifying existing defaults doesn't reduce need for this
            process when adding options or changing defaults.  Unit tests should
            be employed to validating expectations for each deployment client
            that overrides default options (e.g. power-buffer, schema-compare, this api).
            When removing or renaming an option, the compiler will complain (good).
